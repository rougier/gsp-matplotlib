class Measure(Transform):
    """
    A Measure transform allows to convert a measure expressed in
    some units (Pixel, Point, Inch, etc.) to normalized device
    coordinates ([-1,+1] x [-1,+1]). This conversion is always
    relative to a given [Viewport][gsp.core.Viewport] whose width and
    height dictates the conversion.

    !!! Note

        The normalization of a measure (conversion to NDC) migth be
        different on the x or y axis depending on the size of the
        related viewport. This means, for example, that the expression
        `10*pixel` is translated differently along `x` (1st compoeent)
        and `y` axis (second component).

        The `z` coordinate is not changed during conversion since
        measure are targeting 2D coordinates.

    Examples:

    ``` python
    canvas = core.Canvas(512, 512, 100.0)
    viewport = core.Viewport(canvas, color=(1,1,0,1))

    # 10 pixels from bottom left corner
    pixel = transform.Pixel()
    P = [-1,-1,0] + 10*pixel

    # 10 points from left, 20 points from bottom
    point = transform.Point()
    P = [-1,-1,0] + (10,20,0)*point
    ```
